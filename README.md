- 👋 Hi, I’m @TerribleCoding, but that's not my true name 😅
- 🤯 My knowledge is pretty far from a programmer, I'm originally - almost - a mechanical engineer that loves to see and imagine automations in everything
- 👀 I’m interested in building useful web tools that could make life easier to any kind of people.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of HTML, CSS and JS languages
- 📖 I used to code some sketch in p5.js before actually seeing what true JavaScript look like 😄
